# The Job Machine GIF Library

This repo hosts files associated with the official jobmachine.org GIF library. Find the perfect reaction to something by
visiting https://gifs.jobmachine.org/

This repo is also quite large and obnoxious to sync with because it's a bunch of image files.

## Contribute

Fork, add, `./build.sh`, commit, PR. This isn't complicated, folks. Visit the generated files in the `./docs/` folder
with your favorite browser before submitting changes to make sure your file shows up properly.

This site is hosted on Github Pages, so keep in mind the file size restrictions (no images over 100M). It also takes a
minute or two to have changes show up properly.

## Docker

`build.sh` leverages a published docker image, but you can build it yourself with the Dockerfile in this repo.
